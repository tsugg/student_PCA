# student_PCA

This is an unsupervised learning project on a dataset consisting of student test scores. By performing PCA on the numeric data in the dataset, one can observe the relationships between categorical features. Visualing the PCA, it is evident that the model picked up on the differences in scores between males and females. Histograms on the different test topics show that females tend to perform better than males.
